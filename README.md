Hi!

This is my personal website that have built on the animation framework framer motion.

I've made a lot of progress to get to where I am, but I've got a lot to go for where I want to be!

Thanks for taking a look at my designs! I have made reference in code to where I have taken inspiration from. If you have any questions at all, do not be afraid to message me.

Best and well wishes,
Chris
